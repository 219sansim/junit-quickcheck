-- Do we need size control (e.g. maxSize on @ForAll)? Maybe size() gets computed on every generation, as with Haskell QuickCheck?
-- Do we need different random distributions/@Frequency?
-- What other basic generator configs would be useful?
-- What other out-of-the-box generators would be useful?
-- Is the behavior of the out-of-the-box generators sufficient? What should be changed, if anything?
-- Is @SuchThat with OGNL and Paranamer useful, or cute but not that helpful? What about without Paranamer?
