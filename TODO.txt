-- Clarify API of source of randomness
   -- How to guarantee ranges of ints/longs/doubles/floats and less? Big(Decimal|Integer)?
-- Do we need size control?
-- Do we need different random distributions?
-- Do we need @Frequency?
-- What other basic generator configs would be useful?
-- What other out-of-the-box generators would be useful?
-- Is the behavior of the out-of-the-box generators sufficient? What should be changed, if anything?
-- Do we need Coarbitrary for things like Guava functions? What should be considered a functional type?
