-- Do we need size control (e.g. maxSize on @ForAll)? Maybe size() gets computed on every generation, as with Haskell QuickCheck?
-- Do we need different random distributions?
-- Do we need @Frequency?
-- What other basic generator configs would be useful?
-- What other out-of-the-box generators would be useful?
-- Is the behavior of the out-of-the-box generators sufficient? What should be changed, if anything?
-- Do we need Coarbitrary for things like Guava functions? What should be considered a functional type?
-- nextLong(min, max) and nextDouble(min, max) -- getting them to span the entire range.
-- Is @SuchThat with OGNL and Paranamer useful, or cute but not that helpful?

-- site
-- tighten up reporting
